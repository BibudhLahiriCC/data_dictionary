1. Open the latest Google doc that contains the latest data dictionary. Download the sheet "Tables and columns"
   as "casebook_tables_and_columns.csv" and download the sheet "Tables" as "casebook_tables.csv". Keep them
   in some folder in the local machine.
2. Ssh into sandbox. Scp the files casebook_tables_and_columns.csv and casebook_tables.csv into /tmp folder
   of sandbox. Also, scp the script file dataDicDiff.sql into /tmp of sandbox.
3. Launch postgres from sandbox.
4. Compile dataDicDiff.sql by the following command: "\i dataDicDiff.sql".
5. Run the script by "select dataDicDiff()".
6. The script will generate two csv files: casebook_tables_and_columns_new.csv and casebook_tables_new.csv.
   These are raw updated versions of the updated data dictionary. Scp them back to the local machine.
7. Because the files casebook_tables_and_columns_new.csv and casebook_tables_new.csv are copied from postgres tables, 
   columns that have null values may contain "\N", and commas may be replaced by "\,". Check if that has happened. If it 
   has, then replace "\N" by empty string, and "\," by "," globally.
8. Copy entire contents of the sheets casebook_tables_and_columns_new.csv and casebook_tables_new.csv to an excel file
   and name it data_dictionary.xls. Add header rows and convert it to a Google doc. 
9. Do all the manual updates of the data dictionary.
